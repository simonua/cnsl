          <h3>Is this an official web app?</h3>
          <p>No. It is not operated by or affiliated with Columbia Association (CA). CA does not provide an API for publicly-available 
            data and directs users to their websites and app. This web app was created by a swim parent, who wanted an easier, quicker, 
            and more tailored path to get pool and team information. All data used for this web app is accessible publicly via CA websites.<br/>          
            This web app is under active development in summer 2025 with new features planned well before the 2026 season. Stay tuned!

          <h3>What data do you track or keep?</h3>
          <p><b>No personally identifiable information (PII) is tracked.</b><br/>
            This web app uses a standard Google Analytics tag to help me generally understand usage (page hits, mobile or desktop, etc.). 
            This is the default implementation and very common across most websites and apps you may use. The web app is free, and I 
            do not intend to monetize with ads, subscriptions, purchases, selling data (which I don't track anyway), or any other means.
